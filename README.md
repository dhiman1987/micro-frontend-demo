# ðŸ§© micro-frontend-demo

A modular microfrontend playground with 3 independently deployed apps:

- `app1` â€“ Vanilla JS component
- `app2` â€“ Another Vanilla JS component
- `app3` â€“ A React component wrapped in Shadow DOM
- `app-shell` â€“ The main UI that brings it all together, styled and responsive

Each app runs on its own port and is dropped into the shell via `<script>` and custom elements, simulating real-world frontend autonomy.
